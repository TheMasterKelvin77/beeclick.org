Ever wanted to build your own bee-based honey empire? Enjoy this short and fun [incremental game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game) where you build up your bee empire from scratch.

This repository is for adding features and testing them using github pages without affecting the main game. Once changes are tested here and determined to be stable, desired features for the main game, they are pushed to https://github.com/noahzemlin/beeclick.org.
